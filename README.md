What is Salmon?
===============

Salmon is a **wicked**-fast program to produce a highly-accurate, transcript-level quantification estimates from 
RNA-seq data.  Salmon achieves is accuracy and speed via a number of different innovations, including the 
use of *quasi-mapping* (accurate but fast-to-compute proxies for traditional read alignments), and 
massively-parallel stochastic collapsed variational inference.  The result is a versatile tool that fits nicely
into many differnt pipelines.  For example, you can choose to make use of our *quasi-mapping* algorithm by providing Salmon with raw sequencing reads, or, if it is more convenient, you can provide Salmon with regular alignments (e.g. an **unsorted** BAM file produced with your favorite aligner), and it will use the same **wicked**-fast, state-of-the-art inference algorithm 
to estimate transcript-level abundances for your experiment.

Give salmon a try!  You can find the latest binary releases [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases).

The current version number of the master branch of Salmon can be found [**here**](http://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/version_info/latest)

**NOTE**: Salmon works by (quasi)-mapping sequencing reads directly to the *transcriptome*.  This means the Salmon index should be built on a set of target transcripts, **not** on the *genome* of the underlying organism.  If indexing appears to be taking a very long time, or using a tremendous amount of memory (which it should not), please ensure that you are not attempting to build an index on the genome of your organism!
